# 💪 SmartLift — AI Gym Split Generator (MVP)

🚧 MVP in Progress — July 2025 🚧

SmartLift is an AI-powered workout split planner that helps gym-goers avoid muscle group clashes and optimize their weekly routines — no thinking required.

This is a fast-moving solo founder project, focused on delivering value in **weeks, not months**.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Most gym apps are either:

- Overly generic (cookie-cutter routines)
- Overly complex (track everything, do nothing)
- Don’t prevent poor planning (e.g. back-to-back push days)

**SmartLift solves that** by automatically generating a weekly split based on:

- Your goals (hypertrophy, strength, weight loss)
- Days available
- Muscle group recovery time
- Equipment access

## ⚡ Current Status: MVP Build Phase

Goal: Launch a working MVP by **July 31, 2025**
